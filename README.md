Starting with a webscraper with all the basic 9 category stats. We want the last 10 years of player data (fitting, since this is around when the 3 point revolution began in the NBA. player archetypes and positional categorical advantages changed a lot around this time)
First iteration will simply be an examination on the variance of certain stats year over year (we know steals has the higest variance)
Second step will be dealing with the problem of z-score and its flaws (data in basketball is often right skewed vs normally distributed)
